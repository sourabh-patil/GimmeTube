1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,159
you're all watching here's the first

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,900
Fallen just short might have fallen Jess

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,340
short would have been a dramatic start

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,259
to the Innings ball swung late

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,820
yes I think the ball dipped into him and

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,439
that's the reason we had to check his

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,580
shot at the last moment

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,059
swinging Yorker

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,020
didn't quite get it

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
and you might think right left-handed

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,660
have done well against India this

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,640
pressure on the bat

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,860
there's pressure on the bowler too it

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,780
was 160 is the kind of score where you

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,100
need to get off to a really good start

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,120
even for the bowling side

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
it's a very competitive total it's a

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
very very competitive total eight runs

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
Anova is the asking rate for India

20
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,780
now this was a

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,060
Shaheen Shah fredi

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,000
against India in that the 20 World Cup

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,799
last year just watch the lengths he's

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,900
giving the ball time to swing

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,939
Bennett swings back is when the danger

26
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,520
was where was that day and could be

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,840
today

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
it's live in place too

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
[Applause]

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,880
side edge

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,860
not base that it's always the moving

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,860
ball that troubles you always does

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,439
not the pace so much

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
because the batsmen are so used to going

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,400
and playing through the line and when

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,280
that late movement happens like this one

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,259
then you get an Inside Edge you can see

38
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,320
that uh Rahul is looking to push at the

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,060
ball now that is sometimes can be a

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,159
little bit of a dangerous thing

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,799
because what you want to do

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,619
is to ensure that there's not much of a

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,659
gap between Batman particularly because

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,100
he's swinging the ball in

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,020
Mario Rasmus has gone running all the

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,979
way there

47
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,680
oh there's something something on that

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
side screen that's shining that's

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
reflecting the lights

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,440
just the placards that have fallen on

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,800
the screen

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,580
right how are we going to get these out

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,640
[Music]

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
now I think Rohit Sharma said Let It Be

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,680
doesn't bother me Let It Be

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,540
so I think play will start

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,400
that's interesting one one opening

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,260
Batson was getting distracted the other

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,580
said doesn't matter to me

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,959
so whatever it was that was distracting

61
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,420
kale Raul is still there but he's at the

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,260
non-strikers in

63
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,140
now what

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,449
[Applause]

65
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,860
I don't think batsman like this

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,680
as he opened the stands just a little

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,959
bit that's the interesting thing Rohit

68
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
Sharma he does open his stance against

69
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,099
the left hand over the wicked baller

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,780
and he's off the mark too just erring a

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
little on the fuller side so far Shaheen

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,280
Afridi yes I think what we saw when he

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,780
played that warm-up game the other day

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,940
we were looking to get that in swinging

75
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,120
Yorker where he hit the Afghanistan

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,000
opener

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,100
by nastily on the tall he's looking to

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,260
get that going

79
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,959
but both times it has been no full

80
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,500
tosses

81
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,320
drop back

82
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,180
now trying to angle the ball from a

83
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,160
little further outside off

84
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,840
then they're too far outside off

85
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,820
you look at the history of

86
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,680
competition the history of contest

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,380
between these two skewed very heavily

88
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,820
India's way

89
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,040
look at the last three games Pakistan

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,460
2-1

91
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,419
you can see Rohit sharma's backlift is

92
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,460
very very minimal

93
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,580
very very minimal he's aware of the fact

94
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,440
that Shaheen shafridi can get the ball

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,120
to nip back in

96
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,100
you can see that it's not as high as

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
normally is that's a smart thing to do

98
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,960
have a look at that back here very

99
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
minimal hardly goes above the shoulder

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
hardly goes about the shoulder

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080
he started off about 132 that last ball

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
was 140.

103
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,900
three of the over so far

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,699
put it in the Gap it's just a little

105
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:54,539
push

106
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,860
should be good enough for two

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,320
but he was in control first over gone

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,300
fight for no loss with a proper 45

109
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,419
degrees but on the on side is backwards

110
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,060
Square about 10 or 15 meters inside with

111
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,560
45 inside the circle on the onside

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,360
[Applause]

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
he's playing a little bit across the

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,280
line Rahul

115
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,180
what Nasim is trying to do is get the

116
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,560
Fuller length going

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,419
because the ball of Fuller length you'll

118
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,400
get the ball to move just that little

119
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,280
bit and he's got the extra face as well

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,740
so this is a smart bowling

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,539
all he wants to do is make sure he

122
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,160
doesn't go too full this is the length

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,539
this is the length that you want to bowl

124
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,400
this length very well in the initial

125
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,380
overs for India

126
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,639
just wonder whether he wants to get that

127
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,259
ball to swing off middle stump he's got

128
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,699
extra support at midwicket now

129
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,139
[Applause]

130
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,580
if it's a big day

131
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,680
they saw what their new ball goal is did

132
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
it's a wonderful recovery from Pakistan

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
to come so far

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,139
maybe the dusting it's okay we'll

135
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,819
counter the swing there's runs to be had

136
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,560
afterwards

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
see the white ball doesn't move too much

138
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,160
after say about four or five hours

139
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,960
well what is field 360 telling us with

140
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
Nasim bowling to Raul

141
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,960
see the spaces

142
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,900
on the boundary

143
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,419
back for two

144
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,340
and that's the thing about these big

145
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,319
boundaries

146
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,139
you can get two runs comfortably if the

147
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,539
ball is about five or ten meters to

148
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,580
either side of the Fielder

149
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,680
comfortably go for two that's exactly

150
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,880
what the Indians have done

151
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
right where are the spaces those are the

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,020
two men on the boundary

153
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,160
anything in front of the Wicket if you

154
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,419
can beat the court in this point

155
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,220
discover this mid off that's where the

156
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,639
runs are

157
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
well

158
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,900
docking 143 142 already

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,460
I said this is just the first over

160
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,780
wanted to get a little more confidence

161
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,340
when he knows his run-up is right he's

162
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,720
not going to overstep then you can

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,620
really let it drip

164
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,320
it's virtually a full house at the MCG

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,479
then if you if you're coming in here a

166
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,620
little early you could see the

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,080
enthusiasm around they've come from a

168
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,700
long distances to come and watch this

169
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,880
game

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,600
oh it's been on he's played on Gail roll

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,820
once again

172
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,740
and he threw his head back in

173
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,899
disappointment as that happened nothing

174
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,459
in charge produced the Breakthrough

175
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,500
that's the extra Pace it's the extra

176
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,740
base that has got the ball to go on to

177
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
the stumps he played with a soft bottom

178
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,860
hand and with that soft bottom and that

179
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,480
would have gone back just a little bit

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,120
have a look at that yes and that is what

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
happened it would have hit his back leg

182
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,140
and then gone on to the stumps

183
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,019
that is the Breakthrough that Pakistan

184
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,580
were looking for

185
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,500
Gail Rahul

186
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,420
is gone

187
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,399
before India lost their first week at

188
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,760
First Seven

189
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:46,029
[Applause]

190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,550
Virat Kohli in at number three

191
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,200
[Applause]

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,540
first ball Naseem Shah to Virat Kohli

193
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,040
squared up a little bit this is a good

194
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,180
opening burst from the young man

195
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,290
seven for one

196
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,410
[Music]

197
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,530
it should be a good contest Sharma

198
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,360
[Applause]

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
hi the travel just inside though

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,420
wide marker

201
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,820
clever clever bowling he was getting the

202
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,320
ball to nip back in in the previous over

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
this time he angled the ball across to

204
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
the right-hander but this is the Wicket

205
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,140
this is the wicked of kale Brown look at

206
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,200
that

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
playing onto a stumps he's been balled

208
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,779
three times against the pakistanis

209
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,779
how can he get it this long back

210
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,019
and take the single

211
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,800
and you're not going to get too many

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
boundary balls so you've got to be alert

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,420
to the single with our colleague at the

214
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,060
non-strike as in this always always

215
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,680
looking for that single

216
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
we're not going his record against

217
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
pakistanis is very very good

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,519
in recent times is the incoming ball

219
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,899
that's troubled him a little bit more

220
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,540
but there's one player who's probably

221
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,160
the opposition is most apprehensive

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,959
offensive Virat Kohli additional man in

223
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,440
the covers

224
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,440
and again

225
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,300
he's just inducing the angle

226
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
is he setting up Virat Kohli

227
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,800
getting the ball to go straight with the

228
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,880
angle that's what he's done

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,920
look at his t20i career look at

230
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,220
opposition against Pakistan 406 Runs at

231
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,620
67.7 the striker drops a little bit

232
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,620
against Pakistan but he puts runs on the

233
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,740
board that is what India hoping today

234
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,000
this is a little drizzle around

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,240
finds the gap on the offside

236
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
it's a long boundary can they come back

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,540
for three twos on twos what they're

238
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,899
happy with

239
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,279
very good shot the kind of shot that

240
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,139
gives the batsman a lot of confidence

241
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,600
might not have been a boundary but look

242
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,360
at that footwork very positive leaning

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,000
into the drive as well and then finding

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,740
the Gap he wasn't looking to hit the

245
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,260
ball too hard because it's still new

246
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,600
it'll move a little bit so that's very

247
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,959
good bad thing by Virat Kohli now Afridi

248
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,790
goes round the wicket

249
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:17,480
[Applause]

250
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,120
McCauley has had a few problems against

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,579
the incoming delivery

252
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,399
Ball moving in

253
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,760
particularly in the white ball game look

254
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,839
15 times he's got out to The One moving

255
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,820
in

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,959
just one of the fact that he's gone

257
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,420
round the wicked try and angle the ball

258
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,560
in

259
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,639
is it not swinging enough

260
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,120
oh it's a good ball he's doing too much

261
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,019
I think

262
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,420
is doing too much they're all very

263
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,519
excited Mario erasma says no

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,560
stand for one

265
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,120
they were very excited

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,860
but you can see that wall has hit him

267
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,279
high up on the thigh

268
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,779
so they'll be very happy with the dot

269
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,180
ball didn't want to refer it to the TV

270
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,019
Empire

271
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,959
Pakistan past Bowlers can get yes Irish

272
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,320
rauth

273
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
[Applause]

274
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,660
shine shaft really he went round the

275
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Wicket to Virat Kohli and there it is

276
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,639
that ball has come back in it would have

277
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,740
gone over the top of the stumps that's

278
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,720
why they were excited but they knew that

279
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,339
with the height that giant shaft really

280
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,680
has with the bounce that he can generate

281
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,440
there was no point wasting on a review

282
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,620
yes appeal by all means appeal but don't

283
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,300
go for a review

284
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,920
I wonder how Pakistan are going to play

285
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,440
this India had 16 overs I've seen

286
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
Pakistan f-12

287
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,519
[Applause]

288
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,339
Edge The Edge as it carried I think it

289
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,560
they think it has Android Sharma is

290
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
moving away

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,579
Irish Rove has produced yet another big

292
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,300
breakthrough the slip was there for it

293
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,399
and India have been robbed at Denver two

294
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,000
tentative poke

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,600
you can see it's a very tentative book

296
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Ballers bounce a little bit so

297
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,459
absolutely catch this is a terrific cat

298
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,040
it's a low catch these are not easy to

299
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,320
take because against the fast bowler you

300
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,540
expect the ball to come around Johnny

301
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,220
I think for fair catch soft signal is

302
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,970
out no yes

303
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,190
[Applause]

304
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
already in but they want to take a look

305
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
at the catch again I think you'll find

306
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,600
it's clean It's a Wonderful catch by if

307
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,680
the card

308
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,260
to go with his batting but the umpires

309
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,459
just want to be clear and the soft

310
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,120
signal is out

311
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,980
deeper do you have me Deepak for the

312
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,000
best angle for the catch please

313
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,699
interesting position bending but the

314
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,800
batsman's left

315
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,180
new batsman's taking guard

316
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,079
deep back do you have Richard here thank

317
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,120
you keep that rolling through please

318
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,279
keep it rolling through please keep it

319
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,680
rolling through please fingers clearly

320
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,420
underneath the ball I'm ready with my

321
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,720
decision for the big screen

322
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,950
[Applause]

323
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,240
it's better to be safe than sorry

324
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
I think by now Roy charma Degen spats

325
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,380
and pipe that off too

326
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,600
yes you would have seen it he saw it and

327
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,339
that's why he was shrugging his

328
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,780
shoulders when the Empire asked him to

329
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,520
wait he knew that the catch had been

330
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,860
taken clean he was close to the action

331
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,880
as well

332
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,100
and what Pakistan have done what Babar

333
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,199
Azam has done he's added another slip

334
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
he's looking for wickets to push India

335
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,079
back

336
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,720
straight down the ground by men who can

337
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,160
do no wrong in the form he's in

338
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,900
straight back where the bowler came from

339
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,160
for four

340
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,840
it was a wonderful shot this is a

341
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,580
terrific shot

342
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,900
get some swing

343
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,080
over pitching Harris you got a wicket of

344
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,580
the previous delivery getting the ball

345
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,980
to move move having fished it up but

346
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,220
this one maybe just a little too full

347
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,860
allowing to play this gorgeous straight

348
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,799
drive

349
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,960
counter punch

350
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,880
bomb he's in he's not going to hold back

351
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
that is the Wicket they want dare I say

352
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,400
even if gold is at the other end

353
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,840
shot in this land again finds a gap on

354
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,580
the offside

355
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,140
they run well they should look for three

356
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,380
here

357
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,500
and that's the kind of running that you

358
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
need because you're not going to get

359
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,220
boundaries easily while the ball is hard

360
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,000
new and the ball of the bowling so well

361
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,320
with two balls and he's got seven runs

362
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,780
the kind of form that he's in this is

363
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,340
the wicked

364
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,760
yeah look at that just attentive

365
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,980
pork at the ball outside the Austin fine

366
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,140
low catch diving to his right by with

367
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,880
the car you've got a very good half

368
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,919
century and now he's got rid of the

369
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,750
Indian captain

370
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:04,799
[Applause]

371
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
he likes to get off The Mark with those

372
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
dabs down to Third Man

373
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,100
good to see Charlotte comes and has a

374
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,480
laugh with him

375
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,360
Barber will do that too enormous amount

376
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
of respect in this Pakistan side for

377
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,900
Virat Kohli

378
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Kohli

379
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,520
he's got a big job on his hands here

380
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,559
this is field 360 looking at it from

381
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,540
Virat kohli's eyes so what he's seeing

382
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,790
[Applause]

383
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,820
17 for two actions in world cricket

384
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,100
here Rahul and Rohit Sharma and Mohammad

385
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
rizwan and Babar Azam Pakistan 15 for

386
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,810
two India 17 for two there's Nasim

387
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,339
[Applause]

388
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,000
like a fast leg break wasn't it

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,179
and at that piss it's not easy to play

390
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
seem upright then after pitching it just

391
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,200
moves like a fast leg break

392
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,980
a little bit

393
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,059
[Applause]

394
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,640
a Leading Edge every ball is an event

395
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,020
here at the MCG today

396
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,660
and every ball was an event when ashdeep

397
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,820
Singh took the new ball early on

398
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,620
straight away babarasam with his first

399
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,539
ball

400
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,200
the shortfall to uh Mohammed rizwan

401
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,360
that was his third Asif Ali

402
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,760
very interesting to see how babarasam

403
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,080
rotates his fast bowlers

404
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,960
it's in the air but it doesn't matter

405
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,360
it's a long long boundary there can they

406
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,100
run three more

407
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,020
you'll hardly see threes when you see

408
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,880
T20 cricket played on the subcontinent

409
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,100
we've already had two so far in the

410
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,400
ceilings

411
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,539
a bit up in the air he likes to push the

412
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,260
ball away if it's around his hips

413
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,120
I feel it was

414
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,340
at the midwicket more towards midwicket

415
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,740
not towards the squalic Empire otherwise

416
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,480
it could have been a catch

417
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
but that is what India needed to just

418
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,700
break free after the first two dot balls

419
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,380
the pressure easing just that little bit

420
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,720
when you have three runs

421
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,700
here's something interesting now for uh

422
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Virat Kohli the left cover open

423
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
brought an additional man into shot mid

424
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,460
wicket

425
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,710
[Applause]

426
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,740
beard

427
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,299
won't get the second that he wants

428
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,840
there's only one

429
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,299
again see that the ball is moving around

430
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,679
a little bit

431
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,860
because shakoli played

432
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,659
making the adjustment at the very last

433
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,400
moment to the movement to the ball

434
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,840
look at the way he strike trade against

435
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,820
bases 157 again spin 145.

436
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,340
06 than anybody else in 2022 that's a

437
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,840
shot that's fraught with Danger on these

438
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,730
colossal boundaries the MCG

439
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,839
[Applause]

440
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,520
thought during that little collapse in

441
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,000
Pakistan's middle order when Heather Ali

442
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,799
and if the car and

443
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,260
Shada all tried to play big shots and

444
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,620
got caught

445
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,179
these are Big boundaries

446
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,919
he's also the

447
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,360
actor

448
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,740
that's when I could take that into

449
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,360
account

450
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,580
when you go down you realize that there

451
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,260
is a stiff breeze blowing

452
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,100
[Applause]

453
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,240
not a battle with that for Pakistan

454
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,679
fight from it it's 22 for two

455
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,559
still there's Pace in this pitch

456
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,880
yeah and you just want to be back off

457
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,100
the land almost the Test match length

458
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,120
here because

459
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,039
the board is going off the straight

460
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,080
there's a bit of sea movement bit of

461
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
extra bounce

462
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,760
wouldn't really want to piss the ball up

463
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,900
just

464
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,000
stand it up back of a limb

465
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,960
immature really good shot it was just a

466
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,679
fraction short

467
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,820
very very quick eye

468
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,440
yeah just short of a land just too short

469
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,690
this time just marginally

470
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,980
[Applause]

471
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Surya Karma yadavis

472
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,740
so quick at picking up the length

473
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,559
and then being able to execute it's off

474
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,059
the front foot

475
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,220
is just about the time that he's picked

476
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,200
up land and thought I'll pull this

477
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:39,000
lots of spaces go in the air

478
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,220
there's plenty of gaps there's still in

479
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,820
the power play

480
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,020
[Applause]

481
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,080
it's a club that's Pace it's bounce it's

482
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,720
everything for Pakistan an adventure man

483
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,799
is on his way back and not loving it

484
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,260
also done it again short of the lens

485
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,919
even more Biz this time around

486
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,919
been hit to the left side for a boundary

487
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,440
but he keeps pounding in

488
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
the sword is clamping up a room it's

489
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,360
just got big on him good catch from

490
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,460
rizwan in Pakistan

491
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,760
they are in this big time now huge

492
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
wicket

493
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,779
[Applause]

494
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:28,030
in India now 26 for three

495
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,329
[Applause]

496
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,910
[Applause]

497
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,839
[Music]

498
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,279
oh

499
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,960
except Patel is the new player for it

500
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,980
India elevated in the order left-hander

501
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,820
two slips

502
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,880
Patel is facing the music now from how

503
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,299
to roll

504
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,539
and he gets away and he should get two

505
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,779
how does Ralph is actually of all the

506
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,520
players out there got the most

507
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,380
experience of playing here at the MCG

508
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,000
and maybe he

509
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,799
had the assistance of that knowledge

510
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,799
with this delivery

511
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,140
kite in too tight to play a flat bat

512
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,440
shot

513
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,179
Saras Ralph played Seven matches for the

514
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,179
Melbourne stars in the BBL picking up 11

515
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,039
wickets in the process

516
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,779
none more valuable than that one though

517
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,279
let's look how far back the keeper and

518
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,760
the slipper

519
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,220
we see that please mate helped just how

520
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,340
far they're keeping the slipper back

521
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,260
yeah it's just about beef

522
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,600
he's running hard over 90 miles per hour

523
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,240
92 that last delivery

524
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,820
what is the pace and bounce and maybe

525
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,000
slow one but right now is just hitting

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
the Wicket but I I go back to just how

527
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,580
far the keeper and the slipper back

528
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,380
it's just staggering they're almost on

529
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,260
the circle now they're the belts the

530
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,320
bounce and the carry

531
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,720
just look how far that

532
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,150
is a long way back

533
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,600
[Applause]

534
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,820
now they might look for three here it's

535
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
quite nicely timed

536
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,260
although good Pace across the Outfield

537
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,039
brilliant brilliant over 31 for three

538
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,440
shut up comes into the attack from The

539
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,279
Shane warning

540
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,679
pretty good end to bring a spinner in

541
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,480
front

542
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,159
Pace would go out of the game somewhat

543
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,340
now

544
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,400
but we shall just see how Barbara's arm

545
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,559
continues to exert pressure on India

546
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,779
they can't let them collect freely

547
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,240
yeah

548
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,840
normally the go-to bowler for Pakistan

549
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,419
in t20is and

550
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,640
this situation India will probably be

551
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,010
thinking spin on time to attack

552
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,179
[Applause]

553
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,640
Runner should be fumble stuck still here

554
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,820
what a Miss what a complete and utter

555
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,220
Miss and it may well be the skipper

556
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,179
they've got it wrong

557
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,240

[Applause]

582
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:59,760
the biggest sigh of relief there because

583
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,740
his fumble and look at the celebrations

584
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,320
his Bumble nearly cost the opportunity

585
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
and there was another fumble but through

586
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,740

587
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,330

[Applause]

589
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,279
didn't work out for two is 31 for four

590
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:36,630
[Applause]

591
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,799

[Music]

596
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,679
nier is the new player for India Byron

597
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,860
Amis now and Pakistan they got a life

598
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,779
there because I firmly believe they

599
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,460
thought they'd got it wrong they went

600
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,620
back to their positions as if they

601
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,720
weren't going to get a chance

602
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,059
and they got rid of Exile Patel which

603
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,980
means hadapania comes out

604
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,159
but it was the case of fumbles

605
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,899
wasn't pure but it was effective

606
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,290
[Applause]

607
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,620
all a bit frantic

608
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,100
yes no send back Barbara misses it four

609
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
throw rizwan well he thought

610
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,620
that he lost it he didn't get it in his

611
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,980
gloves

612
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,940
his reaction was that

613
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:02,100
we've messed this up

614
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,159
because it's not in his gloves you are

615
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,820
absolutely right

616
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,880
both thought they'd got it wrong they

617
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,320
both thought they got it wrong the body

618
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,299
language was so obvious

619
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,899
and yet somehow they got it right

620
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:22,140
staggering fumble here

621
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,179
fumble there look at the reaction this

622
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,659
one's they

623
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,840
they cannot believe their luck

624
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:38,450
[Applause]

625
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,320
that is Mission has just informed us

626
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,360
should Isaacs and India have never won

627
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,230
when they've been 32 for four

628
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,159
[Applause]

629
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,899
so that will be a first

630
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,220
you can see Pakistan switched on

631
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,520
that new ball burst

632
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,000
now with their best bowler operating

633
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,889
pretty comfortable 33 for four India

634
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,509
[Music]

635
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,000
six for four then for their tie in

636
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
Durban they had the tie and Dave and we

637
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,899
had the bowl out remember that

638
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,000
now getting all of this from the

639
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,099
sideline

640
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,399
Square onto the Wicket

641
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,159
and Isha I've got to say from up here

642
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,080
there's some crazy stuff going on what

643
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,700
about down there

644
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,379
but it's all been happening I have to

645
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,060
say that I tell you what though the

646
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,980
Indian fans a little bit subdued at the

647
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,599
moment at the halfway stage they might

648
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,379
have felt they were in the game

649
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,359
especially with the batting lineup that

650
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,800
they had but Pakistan have been

651
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,839
outstanding they've believed in the

652
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,180
power play they've removed some key key

653
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,060
men and they're all up and about in the

654
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,700
stands currently but don't write India

655
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,859
off because varic Coley is still there

656
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,260
hard at Paddy we know what he can do

657
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,119
especially when he gets going but I

658
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,040
think that last Wicket was a crucial one

659
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,740
he's got to find an ally though who are

660
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,180
these allies

661
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,220
well it's got to be hard at pandya but

662
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,960
the reason I say that last week it was a

663
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,880
crucial one is because it means that

664
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,500
Mohammed Nawaz can come into his work

665
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,060
with that left hand are gone there's not

666
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,040
too many left-handers in this Indian

667
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,200
side so he has the chance to operate

668
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
against the right-handers I thought it

669
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,560
might have been a bit of a dilemma

670
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,859
for barbarism as to when to bowl him

671
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,680
as the fifth bowler but he's been able

672
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,240
to come straight into his work against

673
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
two right-handers

674
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,619
yeah excellent point excellent point the

675
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,300
good captaincy tell you to realize that

676
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,000
that window of opportunity the other

677
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,760
thing that happened to uh is well know

678
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,099
uh the right required run rate just

679
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,500
going up to 10. psychologically 10 and

680
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,240
over all of a sudden in difficult

681
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,260
conditions it seems

682
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
difficult conditions but when you've got

683
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,140
hard at pandia there you know you can

684
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,320
score at 12s 13s 14s and over so for

685
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,240
these two it's about rebuilding it's

686
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,119
about taking it deep like Ms dhoni used

687
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,619
to do we're at curly out in the middle

688
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,540
Virat can run quickly between the wiki

689
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,040
it still just wants to be listening to

690
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,320
work the ball and run those twos hard

691
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,720
and let's not forget Dinesh Karthik one

692
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,460
of the best finishes going around at the

693
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,579
moment

694
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:35,700
[Music]

695
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,860
[Applause]

696
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
yeah look for India now to win this this

697
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,320
next

698
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,420
12.1 always have to go completely their

699
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,180
way you don't have any sort of leeway

700
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,880
Pakistan at the moment passing the game

701
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,099
yes but

702
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,740
they themselves were 44 for two so

703
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,540
there's not much in it at this stage

704
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,859
[Applause]

705
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,560
right now won't hurt Pakistan but build

706
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,859
India in a ways 38 for four

707
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,140
the man at Center Stage here for that

708
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,119
Coley one thinks

709
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,160
nicely bald

710
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,140
I kept a single

711
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,420
and as you say

712
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,240
I will not mind singles Pakistan

713
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,800
big shots that are going to hurt them

714
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,000
they're going to get into your back in

715
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,380
yeah just in this sort of stairs that

716
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,720
middle over stage it's sort of mellowed

717
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,960
down

718
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,960
both sides happy to just sit back

719
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,240
Pakistan morsel

720
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,290
India have been forced to sit back

721
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,920
[Applause]

722
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,200
well we talk about uh who has to do it

723
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,240
well he's done it before

724
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,640
78 not out 57 55 not out

725
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,440
can he do it for a fourth time

726
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,380
[Applause]

727
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,660
the other great thing about having the

728
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,820
World Cup in Australia is that it evens

729
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,099
it up padding first batting second is

730
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,200
there's no Discerning factor of actually

731
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,280
uh added advantage of chasing

732
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,520
the continent you always want to be

733
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,579
chasing much easier back in second

734
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,660
Australia not as simple

735
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,339
well you did the pitch Report with

736
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,220
Michael Clarke and Michael Clarke said

737
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,560
get him on the board get them on the

738
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,500
board probably thought more than uh 160

739
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,740
but get him on the board indeed now

740
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,200
runs always crucial to have on the board

741
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,560
as we see in uh tournament play India

742
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,119
about themselves chasing but they've

743
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,339
lost some crucial wickets here

744
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:12,420
and with that bomb rate being driven up

745
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,520
you just think that

746
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,560
India will have to take a risk or two

747
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,180
against these Spinners he can't just let

748
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,460
them operate as they are at the moment

749
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,160
41 for four

750
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,200
promise you

751
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,359
should defeat nice piece of adjustment

752
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,920
too from Nawaz

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,160
a talked about the matchups the left arm

754
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,980
spin do the right-handed

755
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,720
I don't think they care about the

756
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,400
matchup Decay about the party here

757
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,040
Lakeside Pakistan Lego 99 of their final

758
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,700
10.

759
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,339
now India requires 118 so they'll have

760
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,440
to go some

761
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,020
and it was that little break in play all

762
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,640
that that Prince break that really

763
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,460
kicked Pakistan on after that

764
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,339
maybe India is trying to follow suit

765
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,280
look at rizwan that's beautifully placed

766
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,940
rizwan the keeper is sprinted 40 yards

767
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,760
instead three players have and that is

768
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
placement for Perfection absolute

769
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,579
perfection

770
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,700
just back pocket and came back for two

771
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,400
it's been waited beautifully

772
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,099
all that it didn't go anywhere near

773
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:48,740
those deep feelers and it was in the gap

774
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,339
foreign

775
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,459
[Music]

776
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,900
need a shot of authority in the end

777
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,820
as you say they might wait now they'll

778
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,260
reassess

779
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,780
and two balls time but they need a one

780
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,820
or two shots of authority just

781
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,640
psychologically to put Pakistan

782
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,220
slightly more on the back foot

783
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,320
the ones are fine they'll live with the

784
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,180
ones Pakistan

785
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,579
or two big blows if not now straight

786
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,359
after drinks

787
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,720
yeah I need you to throw some punches

788
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,920
right now everything in Pakistan's favor

789
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,119
one thing that India have come back with

790
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,220
almost halfway through the Innings and

791
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,160
just fours 4.47

792
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,290
[Music]

793
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,839
it ferociously had by haddock paneer he

794
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,099
did well

795
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,820
that was to Parry that away

796
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,280
it is uh 45 for four after 10 overs time

797
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,740
for a drink and time for both sides to

798
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,839
take stock here in Melbourne

799
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,119
the balance now the hard thing when do I

800
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,740
take a risk and how big a risk do I take

801
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,040
I feel like both Hardy can Veer out

802
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,960
there played so much T20 cricket two

803
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,240
class players so India probably couldn't

804
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,920
ask for two better players at the crease

805
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,480
but

806
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,339
it's going to work out what risk will

807
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,079
they take even they look to go hard

808
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,180
along the ground rather than try and hit

809
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,579
that ball over long off for long on just

810
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,200
to try and pick up a couple of

811
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,300
boundaries get some momentum good point

812
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,740
because they bought these borders the

813
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,060
Spinners they don't give too much air

814
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,339
especially shut up it's very difficult

815
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,339
to get under him and hit him for six

816
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,260
so that boundary option becomes

817
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,359
important where you've got to play the

818
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,540
field

819
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,339
so with Pakistan they took that chance

820
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,380
they broke away in two hours of spin

821
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,720
with five sixes and that got some

822
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,380
momentum

823
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,400
when you look at that Innings last 10

824
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,660
over is 99.

825
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,880
that's a fine shot hit hard into the

826
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,099
ground and down the ground for four

827
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,260
the way that I think that's class I

828
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,540
think it's smart fatty it's shortest

829
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,119
shortest boundaries straight look to hit

830
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,920
it hard along the ground you still get

831
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,540
that four I know it's sort of Maximum

832
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,760
but just a couple of those to build some

833
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,800
momentum then you might get a bad ball

834
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,319
you can take a a short for a pull shot

835
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,480
for six or a full toss for six I just

836
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,260
need some momentum

837
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,560
does pack a punch Our Big Pun dip

838
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,119
[Applause]

839
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,740
age of difference here is just the

840
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,839
wickets in hand it's when does India

841
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,079
press you know completely go if they're

842
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,079
two down they'd probably go now 10 overs

843
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,119
nine half overs to go but being four

844
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,400
down they might just have to these two

845
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,740
just go steady for might be two more

846
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,220
overs

847
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,000
that's the thing right yeah you

848
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,160
mentioned till when is it till the 12th

849
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,720
over 13th over

850
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,819
but after that both these players will

851
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,800
have to look for the boundary every hour

852
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,819
at least

853
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,680
but they don't want this uh required

854
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,180
rate to climb with the fastballers

855
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,260
coming back into the attack

856
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,359
all right

857
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,339
in the field cover comes to point as

858
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:54,079
well open up that offside

859
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,819
[Applause]

860
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,800
bowling

861
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,780
man on the boundary just another single

862
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,200
for India

863
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,300
and they'll be quite happy

864
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,480
52 for 45 becomes the first Indian who

865
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,060
is for over a thousand runs and take 50

866
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,460
wickets

867
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,500
T20 cricket V8 overall football

868
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,440
will get two

869
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,300
it's a good over from India's point of

870
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,960
view

871
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,859
nine off it 54 for four

872
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,119
here's mama dabaz

873
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,880
that's a good hit

874
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,520
first six of the innings

875
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,319
it's a great shot from Hardy pandya

876
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,500
stepped away made the following follow

877
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,140
him gave himself a little bit of room

878
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,000
here in Australia with that consistent

879
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,619
bounce he just swings through the line

880
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,920
he realizes he's a very good reader of

881
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,800
the game he captains aside in franchise

882
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,660
fricket

883
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,900
India need a move on here

884
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,760
they need to

885
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,740
get some momentum and put the pressure

886
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,380
back on the opposition

887
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,940
let them know that you're still coming

888
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,099
it's a good start to be over

889
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,240
for a small six

890
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,000
and smart buddy looking to go straight

891
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,280
got their field set up for hardik pundy

892
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,740
out a lot of Defenders a lot of fielders

893
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,079
defending that straight area they've got

894
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,579
instead of a deep point he's more of a

895
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,160
straight cover long off long on really

896
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,200
straight for Hardy pundia they want him

897
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,000
to go across the line

898
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,920
captaincy from Pakistan

899
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,540
yes it's the shorter boundary and that's

900
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,099
what he'll Target either along the

901
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,180
ground

902
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,099
or over the baller's head if he gets the

903
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:02,820
opportunity

904
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:12,000
[Applause]

905
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,220
he doesn't need the boundaries Hardy

906
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,839
could find those but if he can look to

907
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,180
get that ball in the gap

908
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,859

909
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:22,260

937
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,000
screen now signal really missing the

938
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,080
battle review gone

939
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,840
[Applause]

940
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,079
that's a good hit heal the police of the

941
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,839
feet second six of the over the first

942
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,480
football league

943
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,520
's confidence the world are good this is

944
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,380
a beautiful shot doesn't look there

945
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,020
doesn't look over hit it down the Wicket

946
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,180
good use of defeat

947
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,940
again shortest boundary the times is

948
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,880
beautifully head nice and still good

949
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,079
balance

950
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,180
just checks out beautifully

951
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,819
test the kind of all that India need

952
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,980
what two sixes they've got 13 off the

953
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,560
over that's some momentum going there

954
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,300
with still two balls left

955
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,970
smart bearing

956
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,440
[Music]

957
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,540
all peace players they've got the skill

958
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,000
they've got the experience they've got

959
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,359
the temperament for the big occasion

960
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,640
to get things moving very good balance

961
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,540
and he played it

962
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,260
hardik he knows

963
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,180
grabbing momentum

964
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,480
run rate coming down

965
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,900
getting a bit more control back India

966
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,229
[Applause]

967
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,420
that's six more

968
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,119
Stand and Deliver

969
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,119
three sixes in the oval

970
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,040
it's 20 off hits 74 for four

971
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,180
here's a pretty back in the attack

972
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,200
a big over Rafi big over from India

973
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,819
hardik started at first fully over

974
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,339
that's right out of the middle then this

975
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,500
the experience in class if you're at

976
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,079
Coley and hardik finishes it with

977
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,559
another one 20 off the over game on here

978
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,260
this is exactly how Pakistan Broke Free

979
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,260
with three sixes in an oval

980
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,800
but a good cricket from India targeting

981
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,579
the right areas

982
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,400
media change up pace being brought back

983
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,380
he'll want to here

984
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,400
and get it easily

985
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,020
and see the crowd warming up now we

986
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,819
realize this could be a real good

987
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:42,960
contest that's smart batting the MCG

988
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
plenty of those get the ball in the Gap

989
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,880
such a big ground particularly square of

990
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,900
the wicked

991
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,339
pick up lots of twos

992
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,619
[Applause]

993
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,579
oh good feeling

994
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,390
and keep the batsman down to one

995
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,380
[Applause]

996
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,260
so let's now go to a Magic Moment a year

997
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,220
ago tomorrow

998
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,780
[Applause]

999
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,280
this could be the moment this is the

1000
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,640
moment

1001
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,079
ultimate celebrate as with these two

1002
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,040
young men out there

1003
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,300
[Applause]

1004
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,640
so here's a free thing

1005
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,180
and beautifully flicked away

1006
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,059
and find the boundary is using the pace

1007
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:54,260
of the bowler and the angle

1008
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,020
and the 50 partnership comes up

1009
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,480
as it will here opens up this Lakeside

1010
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,599
finally up inside the circle again angle

1011
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,020
in uses the pace

1012
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,480
on 40K he's off the bat even quicker

1013
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,760
chipped in the air he'd get only a

1014
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,020
single

1015
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,359
nine of the over so far so India getting

1016
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,000
those overs they want

1017
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,680
see with this field as well at the

1018
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,319
moment three out on the leg side India

1019
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,300
anything to the leg side unless they get

1020
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,680
at that League glance I think they're

1021
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,480
going to look for two bunted towards

1022
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,760
that midwicket mid-on Circle and push

1023
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,140
for two their boundaries gonna be

1024
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,059
through the offside I think Hardy's

1025
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,740
going to look again either

1026
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,040
I was gonna say I have a mid off but

1027
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,660
Barbara's making a change now mid-off

1028
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,280
goes back to Long off

1029
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,800
third man comes inside the circle so any

1030
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,079
width outside off you might see hardik

1031
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,440
pundy trying to freeze hands

1032
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,020
that's what he might not want to allow

1033
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,440
him to do

1034
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,839
pull into the stuns that's a beauty to

1035
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,200
end the over 83 for four

1036
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,660
but India will Target him in the silver

1037
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,300
last over a spin we saw 20 taken

1038
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,940
that's a good shot it's in the Gap and

1039
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,680
it's traveling

1040
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,200
and it beats the field

1041
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,819
it's the boundary of the first ball

1042
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,760
very powerfully struck

1043
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,740
it's not the worst ball because the

1044
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,300
captain's got the field set for him to

1045
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,760
ball that leg he's got three men on the

1046
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,920
cut shot

1047
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,900
hurray call again timing the placement

1048
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,460
he's got to get it in front of that man

1049
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,680
and he does the man out on the

1050
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,440
boundaries a lot straighter

1051
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,119
very good batting good placement

1052
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,610
foreign

1053
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:14,360
[Applause]

1054
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,000
I think he wants a maximum

1055
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,119
so do they haven't they absolutely got

1056
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,700
back into the game after that big over a

1057
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,240
20.

1058
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:40,920
[Applause]

1059
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,599
this one there

1060
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,980
to cut again three men in that area got

1061
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,839
to get it perfectly in the Gap to get a

1062
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:51,200
boundary

1063
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,190
[Applause]

1064
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,960
nice line hard to freeze hands back of

1065
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,400
the length

1066
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,020
smartly played as well happy to take

1067
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,480
your single good Baba

1068
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,760
used his bowl as well used his Spinners

1069
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,099
very well

1070
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,680
still has one over of uh more than I was

1071
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,240
when does he use it

1072
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
and good delivery

1073
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,200
it's a good comeback after that boundary

1074
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,010
first ball

1075
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:27,559
[Applause]

1076
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:38,209
[Applause]

1077
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,020
uh telling him no we already had one run

1078
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,400
out

1079
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,000
another one will be one too many

1080
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,180
way on the onside just a single good

1081
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,520
over Pakistan's point of view seven

1082
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,900
conceded 90 for four

1083
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:15,960
two is the call

1084
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,540
and he'll get it easily

1085
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,500
is really focused now he is in he has a

1086
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,880
job on his hand

1087
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,700
let's hear what he has to say did you

00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,260

[Applause]

00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,460
whether he's out there in the Middle

1096
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,980
with an opportunity

1097
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,940
for sure

1098
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:54,530
[Applause]

1099
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,619
what that again if you're at

1100
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:02,240
on like up Third Man Out

1101
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,040
it's been a brilliant partnership and

1102
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,480
giving themselves a chance India there's

1103
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,980
no doubt about it

1104
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,460
all week it's early and under the pump

1105
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,920
play the conditions well Pakistan

1106
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,300
deserves so much credit for the way

1107
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,920
they're bowled and even to manage really

1108
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,680
to get to that total one set a target of

1109
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,540
160 after being under so much pressure

1110
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,780
early

1111
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,780
in the fielded world the ground Fielding

1112
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,260
has been good

1113
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,160
it's a good partnership though

1114
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,400
their time and then it was hardik Pander

1115
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,900
who cut loose there are probably

1116
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,220
followed

1117
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,339
using his feet a flurry of sixes that

1118
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,720
set the tone

1119
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,299
on the wrong side of the floor plenty

1120
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,040
more needed of that because this

1121
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,640
required rate

1122
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:58,819
still a steep one

1123
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,780
oh the shot

1124
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:07,579
quick hands good risk

1125
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:09,839
once again playing conditions

1126
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,599
beautifully comes down the weekend

1127
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,280
it's in a couple of slow balls and he's

1128
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,020
over so if you're at Peaks this is not

1129
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,280
going to be off base it's going to be

1130
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,400
quick comes down the Wicket gets it

1131
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,440
angled into the stamps and bang beats

1132
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,760
that man at 45 he knows it's four

1133
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,520
not the worst delivery

1134
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,330
straight but geez it's a good shot

1135
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:37,870
[Applause]

1136
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,540
all these players know that in the final

1137
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,940
overs they can really up the anti a

1138
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,920
dangerous players uh

1139
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,319
being in the in these situations quite

1140
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,400
often

1141
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,619
it's just securing that uh

1142
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,420
they reach a stage where they know all

1143
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,339
they have no choice but to go

1144
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:58,920
even now RAV they got wickets in hand

1145
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,660
only four down but you're about to hit

1146
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,460
the 15th over Mark so they can afford

1147
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,799
the last five to go as hard as they like

1148
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,020
different when it was the 10th over

1149
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,940
yes and with Dinesh Karthik still to

1150
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,250
come

1151
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,839
[Applause]

1152
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:14,520
10 off the over

1153
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,980
100 comes up for the loss of four

1154
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:23,299
it's hot in the combox as well

1155
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,280
I think the game

1156
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,619
rests on the two hours that artistro has

1157
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:33,980
to go

1158
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,530
his partnership with 69.

1159
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:44,280
[Applause]

1160
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,359
harsrove is the death bowler for

1161
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:50,160
Pakistan we haven't seen that slow one

1162
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,900
yet which is

1163
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,420
pretty brilliant but he's decided to

1164
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,819
just smash the pitch

1165
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,960
12 and over required and you feel

1166
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,500
India need a big over something 15 16

1167
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
even more

1168
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,240
next couple need two there's one over

1169
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,280
from Nawaz left

1170
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,200
be interesting to see how Barber is

1171
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,500
playing that one Nawaz over

1172
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,460
[Applause]

1173
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,420
and they get one for the throw they

1174
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,619
can't just a single

1175
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,180
they won't run on the overthrow

1176
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,140
59 now 28.

1177
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,760
a brilliant with the ball today are a

1178
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,400
throw short of a land

1179
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,220
and just kept banging it in

1180
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,520
kept its simple as Pace was up and that

1181
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,430
helped him

1182
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,079
[Applause]

1183
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:54,059
well go down as the defining moment he

1184
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:56,160
was looking very good

1185
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,079
now to Coley

1186
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,040
football again

1187
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,299
remember saying before this tournament

1188
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:04,500
started

1189
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,079
Pakistan's two key cricketers didn't

1190
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,640
think what is one and barber I thought

1191
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,079
it was Shaheen Afridi at the top and

1192
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,310
alishra with the back end

1193
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,920
[Music]

1194
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,200
he's pumped his bowling quick that last

1195
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,400
ball was 148.

1196
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,880
[Music]

1197
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,460
and both of those hard ovals as I'll

1198
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,500
drove in the power play at that back end

1199
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,799
closing in exhaust pre-delivery is just

1200
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,339
a single

1201
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,700
that's what happens with the extra Pace

1202
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,940
the ball hurrying onto the bat and now

1203
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,799
they'll be doing their calculations just

1204
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,500
two runs from this over they know they

1205
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,839
need at least 10 and then hope for a big

1206
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:46,720
finish

1207
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,119
[Applause]

1208
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:50,280
the hardik has no option but to play the

1209
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,839
boundary shot now middle overs

1210
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,260
69 for one India and those nine

1211
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,480
but the first six just 31 for three

1212
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,040
after ten they were 45.

1213
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,220
in both straight

1214
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,819
through the offside maybe is the

1215
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:14,839
opportunity for hardik

1216
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,960
oh dear he did get a glove to it though

1217
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,859
did rizwan

1218
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,020
but that will be called wide there's

1219
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,940
nothing that dampens the spirit of a

1220
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,200
field inside

1221
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,240
then a wide that goes for four it's five

1222
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,220
runs and the ball is encountered

1223
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,140
and this is brilliant from rizwan though

1224
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,660
he's made sure that he saved the

1225
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,460
boundary just a little bit of glove on

1226
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,240
it

1227
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,220
that would might well have been five

1228
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,700
wise if it wasn't for flying rizwan

1229
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,220
they have two there five of the over now

1230
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,240
two balls to come still

1231
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,889
[Applause]

1232
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,190
it's a fine over so far

1233
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:04,380
[Applause]

1234
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,480
in every delivery that doesn't go to the

1235
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,599
fence that required rate jumps up now

1236
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,720
it's 13.2

1237
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,299
remember Harris Road still has another

1238
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:17,760
seven deliveries to go the powers are

1239
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,559
not banking on him to close the Innings

1240
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,079
out and apply as much pressure as

1241
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,660
possible and make it easier for the rest

1242
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,599
well he's done phenomenally this over

1243
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,119
yeah

1244
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,220
young man hasn't seen a lot of

1245
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,319
a lot of cricket

1246
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,619
he's both three overs for 17 so far

1247
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:41,119
just five from this over

1248
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,859
I think he's he's searching for the two

1249
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:45,540
they won't get the two they won't get

1250
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,980
the two

1251
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,079
in retrospect it might have been on but

1252
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:50,940
you can't look in retrospect 106 for

1253
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,180
four

1254
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,280
[Applause]

1255
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,599
single

1256
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,700
done he's done well there crammed the

1257
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,260
batsman for room this is good bowling

1258
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,700
yeah Baba holding that over of Nawaz

1259
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,799
back he knows that

1260
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:16,680
Pakistan could possibly close it out

1261
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,040
in the next couple of hours now holy on

1262
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,400
strike

1263
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,040
boundary riders in front of the wicket

1264
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,559
third and final leg in the circle

1265
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,480
wants to go over the top the timing

1266
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,980
isn't great but he does go over the top

1267
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,280
should come back for two

1268
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,460
[Applause]

1269
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,799
it's just ticking away it's not it's not

1270
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,839
quite speeding for for India this game

1271
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:46,680
it's ticking but it's moving

1272
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,540
yeah they need a couple of blows they

1273
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,400
need boundaries now Pakistan will be

1274
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,680
happy with every delivery that doesn't

1275
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,660
go to the fence

1276
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,000
for that boundary option goalie will

1277
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,720
have to look behind the wicked

1278
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,760
Point short third fine leg

1279
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,040
[Applause]

1280
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,960
swing enemies

1281
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:17,880
[Applause]

1282
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,680
I think he was looking to go over Third

1283
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,240
Man you'd see the field was at shot

1284
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,520
third both of them

1285
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,039
standing outside just coming in as the

1286
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:27,720
ball is about to be delivered so this is

1287
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,000
what Virat is seeing deep mid Wicket

1288
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,880
it's a long distance away somewhere far

1289
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,619
away in the distance is deep midwicket

1290
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:36,420
he'll have to stray in his eyes to see

1291
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,839
long gone

1292
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,119
a very good looking shot but it's only a

1293
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,339
single ride we just heard Smithy that

1294
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:48,680
there's 90

1295
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,720
238 people down it's 239 now now that

1296
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,180
you're gone is it cold can you feel the

1297
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,859
heat in the stadium well actually it is

1298
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:58,200
241 now because Ravi shastri's joined me

1299
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,720
down here as well so it is cold it is

1300
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,339
cold hash you stay up there don't worry

1301
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:03,780
you stay nice and warm up there we'll

1302
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,000
just get the tension the icy tension

1303
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,099
down at ground level here you can feel

1304
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:10,380
it though you can sense it it is just

1305
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,760
brilliant the crowd are loving it

1306
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,020
foreign

1307
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,500
[Applause]

1308
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,260
they need a boundary in all seriousness

1309
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,339
India need a boundary these are two

1310
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:31,740
terrific plays at the crease

1311
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,599
but even the crowd the knowledgeable

1312
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,240
ones and the crowd know that ones are

1313
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
not gonna get it done

1314
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,460
this has been a terrific over of bowling

1315
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,380
and the and the previous one from

1316
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,859
artistrove only four so far

1317
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,859
hardik

1318
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:53,460
but taking one for the throw Virat will

1319
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,260
get there doesn't hurt Pakistan that

1320
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,539
just two runs of it six game from it

1321
01:07:57,539 --> 01:07:59,980
it's one one two for four

1322
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,210
[Music]

1323
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,660
[Music]

1324
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:33,060
[Music]

1325
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,420
at the same point Pakistan 125-7 it

1326
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,100
started to move ahead

1327
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,189
India 112 for four

1328
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,259
[Music]

1329
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:44,759
it's really always wanted down there

1330
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,100
have you seen real quality face how does

1331
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,839
it look like from down there the face

1332
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:50,640
that these three borders are generating

1333
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,500
oh that's the quickest pitch I'm saying

1334
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,239
in this competition so far without doubt

1335
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,980
it's been carry throughout you only have

1336
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,940
to look just how far back Muhammad

1337
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,779
ruswan is

1338
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:02,640
his confidence gonna get carried there

1339
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,739
he's backed that far also because he's

1340
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:06,480
trying to cut off the ramp shot that

1341
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,600
goes fine does it but there is genuine

1342
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,100
Pace in this pitch we'll see it now

1343
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:18,859
puts it in the Gap gets it over

1344
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:23,000
50 comes up

1345
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,900
for Virat Kohli

1346
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,460
he's a run machine when it comes to

1347
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,799
playing against Pakistan let us land at

1348
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:34,560
about 15 yards away to my right and I

1349
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,239
believe it's landed inside the line

1350
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,279
inside the barrier just

1351
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,980
glad you're getting the replay right

1352
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,900
this is uh this is Smith vision

1353
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,000
Smith vision is spot on

1354
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,699
that's four

1355
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:55,260
cheese maybe your eyes are getting

1356
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,880
sharper with Edge

1357
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,980
oh one bit far away I said it'll be fear

1358
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,440
but every one of those is crucial every

1359
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,060
one of those is crucial we are going

1360
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,500
close here

1361
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,140
you were gonna call something very close

1362
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,540
to a super over here hashaboglay no

1363
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,420
Smithy no Smithy you and super always

1364
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,120
50km of 43 balls but a boundary of the

1365
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,500
first

1366
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,940
wide down the lake side Shaheen Afridi

1367
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,620
is the pressure telling just a little

1368
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,179
bit they've got loads of runs in the

1369
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,760
bank but just seems a precious telling a

1370
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,190
little

1371
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,360
[Applause]

1372
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,000
India want this to be the over it's

1373
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,739
about time you can't really afford

1374
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:37,020
another one of those where they don't

1375
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,739
get a big over

1376
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,280
has to be

1377
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,380
first delivery going for five

1378
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:52,560
beautifully ball now Coley wants to is

1379
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,060
very quick between the wickets

1380
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,940
he just manufactures runs against

1381
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,100
Pakistan his average is 67 the strike

1382
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,080
rate is a little low but he just keeps

1383
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,580
scoring runs and today's held this

1384
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,679
Innings together question is can you now

1385
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,699
give it the finishing kick

1386
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:12,860
thank you

1387
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,910
[Applause]

1388
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,219
seven of the over so far from two

1389
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,679
squeezes it all up it's in the Gap there

1390
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:26,940
but does it have enough to go to the

1391
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,980
boundary it's a bit of a race it goes

1392
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,199
through Virat Kohli hits another

1393
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,170
boundary it's 11 of the over from three

1394
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:37,560
[Applause]

1395
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,640
backing away turning on Virat Kohli now

1396
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,120
Giants are pretty trying to follow him

1397
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,179
but he's been able to just maneuver it

1398
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,940
over extra Kaba

1399
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,580
this is fabulous bearing

1400
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,340
be able to place it and time it so well

1401
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,520
that he gets another boundary

1402
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,400
of India left it till too late or is

1403
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,260
there still a huge twist in this story

1404
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,480
now Shaheen Afridi is going back he's

1405
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,660
going over the wicked

1406
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:14,560
[Applause]

1407
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,340
hurried up on him

1408
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,100
he wants a second hard dick says no I'll

1409
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,320
handle the strike for a while

1410
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,659
how noisy is it Smithy down there well

1411
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,340
you wouldn't heard the call you have to

1412
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,560
use hand signals out there hasha it's

1413
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,659
impossible to hear anything to be fair

1414
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:33,840
that is just it as I said before in

1415
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,800
commentary

1416
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,920
hands down the most amazing atmosphere I

1417
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,300
have ever heard of the game of cricket

1418
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,719
ever

1419
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,100
and stuff in rugby but it couldn't be as

1420
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,140
noisy as this no it couldn't be it could

1421
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,600
not be

1422
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,320
seriously this is special

1423
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,100
now what can hardik do here 37-32

1424
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,860
well balled again the hitting that

1425
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,260
banging into the middle of the wicket

1426
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,420
yes work that length has worked

1427
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,280
especially against hardik they've been

1428
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,620
able to pull that short ball and the

1429
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,060
slow bouncer

1430
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,280
which has been difficult to get away

1431
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,300
13 off the over but they still need more

1432
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,100
he looks like we might be carrying a bit

1433
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,500
of a nickel too

1434
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,820
running might be a factor if they have

1435
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,940
to

1436
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,320
they're not going to win it by running

1437
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,239
though Smithy

1438
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,340
13 of this over

1439
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,460
ly goes over the infield for four that's

1440
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,920
the over they wanted Gerard Coley is

1441
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,659
turning it on in style here and the

1442
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:42,480
stadium is dancing to his Beats it's 129

1443
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,980
before 31 needed of two

1444
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,430
[Applause]

1445
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,320
yeah beautiful place this time the short

1446
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,500
one we are just getting inside it and

1447
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,199
helping it over

1448
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,540
yo that India needed they need more but

1449
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,770
Murad has turned it on

1450
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:14,929
[Music]

1451
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,400
the same point Pakistan was six ahead

1452
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,500
coming down to that dreaded 19 dollar

1453
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,659
but it's dreaded 19 to an India bowling

1454
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:28,980
and as you'd imagine it's already Shroff

1455
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,179
this is the old for the match for

1456
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:30,760
Pakistan

1457
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,420
[Music]

1458
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,400
14 15 at least of this one

1459
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,140
right bazid what's he going to do you've

1460
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,239
seen so much of various going to pull

1461
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,920
the slow ones into the deck the quick

1462
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,470
Hawkers

1463
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,960
[Applause]

1464
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,000
I think it's going to be into the deck

1465
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,219
even if it's slow it's still going to be

1466
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,560
into the deck

1467
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,900
find leg is up but third man is out on

1468
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,980
the boundary for the uppercut

1469
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,060
let's put that in the Gap no he hasn't

1470
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,159
just the single but it's viratus turning

1471
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,540
it on who's now back in strike

1472
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,800
but I said I've got a question with you

1473
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,500
who both the last over who has the

1474
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,540
bowler last over

1475
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,400
I think

1476
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,900
oh no he's finished oh he's got one from

1477
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:23,159
Nawaz left yes exactly

1478
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:26,300
so

1479
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,520
[Applause]

1480
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,120
our stroke doesn't want to go for 14-15

1481
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,400
that's what Barbara is thinking Irish

1482
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,580
roof can just go for maybe 10 12 and

1483
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:41,900
that leads enough for Nawaz

1484
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,560
on test

1485
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,719
single

1486
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,820
two in the Asia cup and artist Ralph

1487
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,780
both the 19th and I think pandeya got 14

1488
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,820
of that leaving just six for Nawaz to

1489
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,680
bowl the last over

1490
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,100
[Music]

1491
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,280
foreign

1492
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,740
[Applause]

1493
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,739
Partnership of 75 they have come back

1494
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:12,840
into the game but there's still a lot to

1495
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,020
do

1496
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,960
what Mrs Mrs hardik's been be calmed a

1497
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,400
little bit I didn't think you'd say that

1498
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,920
with him and Virat bedding

1499
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,800
this is brilliant from Harris

1500
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,920
one banged into the pitch he's gone for

1501
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,540
that delivery more often than not

1502
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,120
because of the surface because of the

1503
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,520
way hardik plays he's attacked him that

1504
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,600
way

1505
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,640
how many from the last over does he

1506
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,860
leave uh he's got to leave he's got to

1507
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,239
leave if he can

1508
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:47,760
if he can he's got to leave 18 I believe

1509
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,880
18. there you go we've seen a 20 over a

1510
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,400
couple of times

1511
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,800
[Applause]

1512
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,940
29 still

1513
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,800
hurries up on him no timing at all is

1514
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,260
Virat gonna go for two no viratel take

1515
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,659
the strike this is outstanding from

1516
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:07,080
Irish Rove so far 28 of eight

1517
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,560
second

1518
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,659
is trying to hit that short link too far

1519
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:14,040
in front of the ground I would be

1520
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,140
surprised that ferrat Kohli uses that

1521
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,420
pace in a different fashion pretty hard

1522
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,100
to combat that flat batting down the

1523
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,540
ground

1524
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,520
[Applause]

1525
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,560
there's a third man down there who's so

1526
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,659
fine for the uppercut but fine leg is

1527
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:29,159
inside the circle

1528
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:32,300
they're looking for power

1529
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,520
goes down the ground goalie goes out of

1530
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,600
the ground

1531
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,840
wow this is a sensational hit from Virat

1532
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,080
Kohli

1533
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,360
68-49 is turning it on is this the Virat

1534
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,920
Kohli you could score a run some time

1535
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,440
back he's come back in some Style

1536
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,380
what a shot this is

1537
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,719
a slow one into the pitch and he's just

1538
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,360
stood tall on top of the bounce and he's

1539
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,800
hit it big

1540
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,560
with almost a straight back

1541
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,780
India needed this they need another one

1542
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,060
but this is quality

1543
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,580
what a big delivery in the context of

1544
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:13,080
the game you talk about 240 balls

1545
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,420
this is so big now third man is coming

1546
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,199
up fine leg is dropped back

1547
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:21,300
come on

1548
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,880
they want to keep Pena on strike

1549
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,320
Pakistan whatever happens here

1550
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,739
[Applause]

1551
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:34,679
he has what a way to end it on his

1552
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:37,080
revolver that was looking so good two

1553
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,199
sixes India now needs 16 Hope Springs

1554
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:43,679
are new what a game we've got 144 for 4

1555
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,520
16 to get

1556
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,719
yeah this is the man strong Virat Kohli

1557
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:54,120
last couple of deliveries this time just

1558
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,480
a flick let the ball come on

1559
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,140
glass off the man deposits that into the

1560
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,659
stands he knows those two deliveries

1561
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:06,300
have brought India back they needed it

1562
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:11,179
it's still not done but India are back

1563
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,880
13 the partnership now from 79. Smithy

1564
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,400
who said 18 at 16 Smithy of the last

1565
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,060
over that was the second ass delivery

1566
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,460
will look long in my mind that shot is

1567
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,679
not an impossible for a Norman human

1568
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,560
being to hit that link back down over

1569
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,420
the bowler's head on a very long

1570
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,699
boundary for six was quite astonishing

1571
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:35,340
that forced the error hopefully in the

1572
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,560
last delivery and I always knew that

1573
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,719
he'd use the pace to his Advantage down

1574
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:41,940
the ground down past fine League this

1575
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,159
guy is a genius he might not win it but

1576
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,620
he's a genius

1577
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,480
you just love the pressure there are

1578
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,159
some people who get buoyed by pressure

1579
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,659
there's some people look at burdened by

1580
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:52,980
it I think Goldie gets buoyed under

1581
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,450
pressure

1582
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:57,580
[Applause]

1583
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,600
blasted water I mean I know somebody

1584
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,580
talked about the one down the ground you

1585
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,320
don't always see Virat played this one

1586
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,100
over fine leg

1587
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,960
yeah 16 to get left arm spin

1588
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,360
hardik will fancy himself really

1589
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,699
with spin on

1590
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,219
there's so much discussion so much

1591
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:34,800
pressure riding on these first couple of

1592
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,480
deliveries and look where Muhammad

1593
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,420
rizwan is standing to spin

1594
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,560
the keepers four to five meters back

1595
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,360
how would that be still Smitty they do

1596
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,380
not want

1597
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,179
to steal one they do not want him to

1598
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:49,980
work it fine they want to keep hardik

1599
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,080
paneer on strike that is what they've

1600
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,239
been talking about

1601
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,340
Isaac is a fabulous player of spin but

1602
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,520
he's struggling a bit to their 40 of 36.

1603
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,219
right here we go 16 to get from six

1604
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:05,699
balls 90 000 people at MCG got us how

1605
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,199
many millions around the world and what

1606
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,300
a spectacle you've had so far

1607
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,820
cover is long and deep long gone and

1608
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,340
long off right behind the bowler so is a

1609
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,920
very straight midwicket here's the first

1610
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,659
ball it's a Miss hit it's a mishead

1611
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:24,540
the catch is taken it means the new

1612
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,820
batsman is in strike Virat Kohli thinks

1613
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,040
he's crossed over it doesn't matter this

1614
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,739
is a huge ball Muhammad Nawaz has

1615
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:34,140
delivered

1616
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,540
yeah I wanted to go Lakeside swung

1617
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,980
through

1618
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,140
maybe trying to hit it too hard but

1619
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,760
doesn't matter nobody cares really

1620
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,420
because it's just gone in the air

1621
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,260
not trying to spit it is no us

1622
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,719
yeah it's Barber keeps calm takes the

1623
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:54,179
catch it's a DOT ball you Bassman all

1624
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:56,520

1625
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,679
with the ascendancy

1626
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,560
are they for 48 144 for five

1627
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,859
[Music]

1628
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,219
37 years old in his Karthik is that a

1629
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:14,040
wonderful day as a wicket keeper but

1630
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,719
these are the situations that you dream

1631
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:16,920
of

1632
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,320
sometimes people think you're 37 years

1633
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,699
old you should be watching other people

1634
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:22,920
play but his perseverance his

1635
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,080
determination he's worked hard and now

1636
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,820
he's coming to a situation it's very

1637
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,280
cold out in the middle but we've got to

1638
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,760
turn the heat on and get 16 or five well

1639
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,340
does he does he hasha what have they

1640
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,140
talked about what have they talked about

1641
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,420
what has Coley said to him give it to me

1642
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,640
just get one give it to me I can win

1643
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,560
this the way I'm hitting it or does he

1644
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,900
say be bold be brave you go

1645
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,199
is in the side to do that he takes a

1646
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,960
single then it's only

1647
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,659
15 or four then you need four boundaries

1648
01:22:57,659 --> 01:22:59,640
it's a fabulous result for Pakistan this

1649
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,860
first ball and remember you cannot cross

1650
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,199
over anymore the new batsman is in what

1651
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:05,940
does Karthik do he plays The Sweep shot

1652
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,090
very well

1653
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,520
[Music]

1654
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,679
not much power he had made up his mind

1655
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:12,719
early on it's a wonderful start for

1656
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,980
Pakistan

1657
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,620
Coley wants to know who is scoring for

1658
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,860
height

1659
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,640
is having nothing over

1660
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,679
yeah he just signal that

1661
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,620
DK was halfway down the track so

1662
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:31,920
no no ball four deliveries 15 to get now

1663
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,080

tonight

1704
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,320
[Applause]

1705
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,480

long

1707
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,400
yeah

1708
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,739
to give him some help here

1709
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,020
right the Square Lake umpire has to make

1710
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,000
the call

1711
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,760
again

1712
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,159

1713
01:25:49,159 --> 01:25:51,659

Mario erasma says his great ability to

1716
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,580

1717
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,520
they need six of three now is there

1718
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,320
another twist in this game it's India's

1719
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,920
at the moment

1720
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,600
was that about waste high was it the

1721
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
umpires rule so it's six of three now

1722
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,880
six or three and how the pendulum swings

1723
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,380
towards India again

1724
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,500
[Applause]

1725
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,840
demanded the no ball straight away

1726
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,529
[Applause]

1727
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,560
he wanted to do it of the earlier ball

1728
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,840
too Dinesh Karthik at the non-strike his

1729
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,840
end is waiting now we're at the game is

1730
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,120
in your grasp Nawaz has three balls to

1731
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,300
go

1732
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:44,880
six to get what we're not going to do

1733
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,520
here that's wide five to get now the

1734
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,739
pressure is on the bowler who would have

1735
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:51,120
believed that this game would have that

1736
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,300
Sensational twist as this one this match

1737
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,760
was gone it was in Pakistan's pocket and

1738
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,380
Virat Kohli

1739
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,239
is pulling it out at the moment but

1740
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,120
there's still five to get and it's still

1741
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,659
a three hit

1742
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,659
rally holds all the aces right now he's

1743
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:14,000
been brilliant five of three now

1744
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,300
as he believed do Pakistan believe

1745
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,280
he's knocked him over but then take the

1746
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,679
run it's running away down but surely if

1747
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:24,679
it hit the ball with his the stumps

1748
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,520
they're coming back for three

1749
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,719
they get three of it

1750
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:36,540
was a free hit remember it was a free

1751
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,780
hit

1752
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,840
yeah inquiry now rizwan doesn't like it

1753
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,340
it is

1754
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,639
let's hit the stumps on the ball should

1755
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:48,780
be dead

1756
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:52,100
it was a free hitter

1757
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,990
so they've run three

1758
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:59,820
[Applause]

1759
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:03,860
what's it like down there that's crazy

1760
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,080
it's grown man damn it crying summer

1761
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,800
puzzled summer jubilant Ravi shastri is

1762
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,480
standing right next to me I don't think

1763
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,060
he's seen anything like this ninety

1764
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,639
thousand ninety thousand you think it's

1765
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:22,340
fairly for money three buys

1766
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,960
suddenly Pakistan are staying down

1767
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,719
defeated cleaning up the ball ricocheted

1768
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:31,800
and Murat kept running saw the DK

1769
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,580
and he came back for the Third

1770
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,739
calm down where are the same calm down

1771
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:39,480
he said it's not always that he says

1772
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,020
calm down but there's two of two

1773
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,719
what does Dinesh Karthik do here Virat

1774
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:47,940
kohli's off strike for Pakistan but he's

1775
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,860
off strike with just two to get off two

1776
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,620
it was that no ball for height

1777
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,940
eventually

1778
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:56,400
Ryan how are they going to play does he

1779
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,139
tell Dinesh Karthik go for it what if he

1780
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:00,300
misses does he say take a single let's

1781
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,719
level the scores and give it back to me

1782
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,400
what's happened here is rizwan has now

1783
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,739
come up for the stunts because they need

1784
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:10,500
to get kartik out they need to get him

1785
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,560
out and that brings a new player out if

1786
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,080
Coley can't get back on strike so that's

1787
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,820
why he's come up to the stunts for a

1788
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,580
genuine dismissal the medium pace it's

1789
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,340
not work it hasn't been accurate enough

1790
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,500
trust the keeper to spot what the keeper

1791
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,719
is doing here where does Karthik get the

1792
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:30,000
single would that be his first goal

1793
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,179
because Smithy is absolutely spot on

1794
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:35,520
a wicket here and the new batsman comes

1795
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,620
in with Pakistan still having a run in

1796
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,300
the bank

1797
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,219

three on the onside there's still only

1801
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,860
four inside the circle

1802
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:54,020
this game is still alive but only just

1803
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,719

they get the chance they've got to be

1846
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,400
hunting in closer over the top Soviet

1847
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,679
he's pulled it back he has pulled it

1848
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,700
back nowaz it's a wide

1849
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,960
[Applause]

1850
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,030
[Music]

1851
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,900
[Applause]

1852
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:18,300
nakistan now it's got to be a super over

1853
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,460
if they have to win it and that was very

1854
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:23,100
very clever from ravichandran Ashwin he

1855
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,960
quickly realized the ball was outside

1856
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,719
the Lake's dumb they didn't back away

1857
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:30,600
stayed where he was there was thought

1858
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,159
that he'd back away and he tried to

1859
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,320
follow him

1860
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:37,380
now India just need one

1861
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:40,199
game just keeps giving and giving his

1862
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:44,340
spin stupendous this last over

1863
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,280
right everybody's inside everybody's

1864
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,560
inside to cut the single now what

1865
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,659
they've got to ensure is look for the

1866
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:54,060
run out opportunity at the non-strikers

1867
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,340
end with Ashwin running there Kohli will

1868
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,120
run

1869
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,159
Nawaz are you watching by Virat is

1870
01:32:59,159 --> 01:33:01,080
inside the crease as you run into ball

1871
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,179
the scores are level one run to get

1872
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,100
there's still a couple of people out in

1873
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,400
the Deep

1874
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:09,770
infield

1875
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:10,210
[Applause]

1876
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:13,400
[Music]

1877
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,800
[Applause]

1878
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,280
India have been a famous win you look at

1879
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,980
all the great wins over the years and I

1880
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,020
think you'll find very very few to

1881
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,600
compare with this one this game was gone

1882
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,960
Virat Kohli pulled it back what a

1883
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,840
champion what an absolute Champion

1884
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,480
without goalie is and now ravichander

1885
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,719
naswin keeps its cool produces the wide

1886
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:42,179
then goes over this must be

1887
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:44,940
heartbreaking for Pakistan but Smithy

1888
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,380
down there there must be absolute

1889
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,100
pandemonium

1890
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,639
[Music]

1891
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,100
did you see Coley's reaction he bit down

1892
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,500
and he punched the first under the under

1893
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,320
the pitch he has played so many special

1894
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,480
winnings but what does this mean harsher

1895
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:12,179
how high does this rate I think I'm

1896
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,100
spotting a deer in Virat kohli's eyes

1897
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,920
I've seen Virat Kohli play for so many

1898
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,199
years I've seen some of his best Innings

1899
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:21,480
but I have not seen a tear in his eyes

1900
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,600
and I think I spotted a tear

1901
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,260
Paul wicket

1902
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,440
s

1903
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,060
pulled it out of the bay India were

1904
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,679
almost dead and buried with what an

1905
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:36,840
Innings he's playing even in the last

1906
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,300
over it's all been where I'd call the

1907
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,880
Pakistan well they all think they've

1908
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,380
been

1909
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:48,120
taken away the victory from the hand

1910
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,580
this is what you play for

1911
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,860
when you've retired when everything is

1912
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,659
done these are the moments you remember

1913
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:57,420
and Ashwin how clever was Ashwin after

1914
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,520
India lost Dinesh Karthik

1915
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,100
and now Virat the king

1916
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,900
we'll just look around this packed

1917
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,179
Melbourne cricket ground Rohit Sharma

1918
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:07,800
watch your back but

1919
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,199
it matter today

1920
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,179
isn't it 90

1921
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:14,400
000 people are singing and cheering and

1922
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,120
dancing here

1923
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,940
this was Pakistan's game

1924
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:24,420
goes back to the hussy moments it goes

1925
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,580
back to the Wade moments and now it

1926
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:28,620
comes to the Kohli moments they've got

1927
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,060
to come fighting back this is difficult

1928
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:33,659
to digest now 48 in the last three

1929
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:37,440
Pakistan were way in front and this man

1930
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,440
just kept coming and coming and kept

1931
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,320
them in the hunt and in the end it was

1932
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,400
because of him that India now celebrates

1933
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,040
most of this 90

1934
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:54,000
000 attendants in the crowd celebrate

1935
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,199
water

1936
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,440
game we've just witnessed Pakistan well

1937
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,080
they made a few comebacks in the game it

1938
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,780
just went one way and the other and in

1939
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,960
the end the class of the man prevailed

1940
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,300
I remember saying when Robert is out of

1941
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,520
bomb it's always England

1942
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,260
to the rescue for Virat Kohli it's

1943
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,179
always Australia he loves playing in

1944
01:36:15,179 --> 01:36:17,639
these conditions but his record against

1945
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:20,900
Pakistan is astonishing

1946
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,840
whose record against Pakistan and he has

1947
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,820
pulled this match out of absolutely

1948
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:29,639
nowhere you look down their total 160

1949
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:32,400
for six Virat kohli's played 53 walls

1950
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,620
for 82.

1951
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:37,139
these Virat it is Innings like these

1952
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:39,300
that take you beyond the present and

1953
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,020
into Legend

1954
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,179
This Is The Stuff Legend is made up

1955
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:46,980
forget it was Ashwin with the winning

1956
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:49,380
hit the field was in he kept to school

1957
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:52,199
just time the shot didn't try to hit it

1958
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:53,940
too hard

1959
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,920
and he knew straight away he had done

1960
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,040
enough

1961
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,600
240 balls basically they came down to

1962
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,659
one no ball an inch over maybe that's

1963
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:06,239
all it came down to

1964
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:10,340
in the Roar from Virat Kohli

1965
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,440
punching the ground

1966
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,360
there's so much bottled up inside Virat

1967
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,820
Kohli that is where the tear would came

1968
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,340
out

1969
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,780
hardik knew he was struggling and hardik

1970
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,760
was struggling viraj was the one who

1971
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,100

well um we're not before you start

1979
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,900
you have to collect the award from Mr

01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,900
Bean thank you sir thank you very much

1981
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:09,540
player of the match tell us well um

1982
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,860
it's a

1983
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,800
it's a surreal atmosphere

1984
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,500
um I honestly have no words I have no

1985
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,540
idea how that happened

1986
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,340
um I heard they kept telling me you know

1987
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,199
just believe in believe we can do it

1988
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:24,480
stay till the end

1989
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,840
um I honestly I'm lost for words no you

1990
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,340
had a good partnership going which was

1991
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,219
much needed when did you decide you both

1992
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:35,280
had to go oh one had to go well uh I

1993
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,260
think when Shaheen bowled from this end

1994
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,540
the Pavilion end that's when I kind of

1995
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,040
spoke to hardik that we need to take him

1996
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,480
down and then the conversation was

1997
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,460
simple he said Nawaz has to bowl one

1998
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,920
over so I told him if I can take Harris

1999
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,880
down

2000
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,920
then they will kind of you know panic

2001
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,980
because he's their Prime bowler so I was

2002
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:54,540
kind of pumping myself up to hit two

2003
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:57,300
sixes when we needed 28 of it and that

2004
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,920
became 16 of six so I mean

2005
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,900
I I'm kind of lost for words I have no

2006
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,679
idea two special shots of Harris Road

2007
01:39:06,679 --> 01:39:09,440
you know what's that anticipation or

2008
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,900
prevented it had to be premeditated yeah

2009
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,840
um it's just instinctively I I saw the

2010
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,360
and I told myself just stay still the

2011
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,159
one I had long on was unexpected it was

2012
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,380
back Overland slower ball and then the

2013
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,520
next one I

2014
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,400
I just you know uh just swung my bat

2015
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,780
through the line of the ball and it just

2016
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,639
flew over fine leg

2017
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:31,380
and now standing here I just feel like

2018
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,020
this was meant to be I mean it's it's a

2019
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,880
very very special moment where does the

2020
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,000
settings rank in your T20 career

2021
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,340
well um

2022
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,500
I've till today I've always said Mohali

2023
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,900
was my best Innings against Australia I

2024
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:49,320
got 82 or 52 today I got 82 or 53. so

2025
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,040
they're absolute

2026
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,360
they

2027
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,520
exactly the same innings

2028
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,440
but I think today I will count this one

2029
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,060
Higher because of the magnitude of the

2030
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,820
game and what the situation was it

2031
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,219
seemed impossible but then hard they

2032
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:07,500
kept pushing me in that partnership and

2033
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,540
we just went deep

2034
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,000
and it just happened an award for this

2035
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,960
